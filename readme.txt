hi this is the repository for vrcplayspacemover

this is an attempt to revive playspacemover for vrchat,
though it has no 3d "hold button and move controller"
functionality in it yet (i suck at math ok?)

basically, hold A to go up, hold X to go down.

doesn't require any game files to be modified.
(it uses my [UnityAssemblyInjector](https://github.com/avail/UnityAssemblyInjector) to load the code in)

will be broken when the game updates, unless 
someone feels like doing reflection for the needed functions (OVRInput class)

downloads in releases tab, drag and drop to vrchat's folder in `Oculus\Software\Software\vrchat-vrchat`.
